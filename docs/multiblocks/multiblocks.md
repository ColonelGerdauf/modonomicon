# Multiblocks

Multiblocks in Modonomicon have two functions:
- They can be used to display a multiblock structure in the book (see [Multiblock Page](../basics/page-types/multiblock-page)) and preview it in-world to allow players to build a specific shape easily.
- Further, they can be used to verify if a multiblock is correctly built (see [Using Multiblocks in Code](using-multiblocks-in-code)), allowing you to create custom multiblock machines.

To use multiblocks you first need to define the shape of the multiblock. Head over to **[Defining Multiblocks](defining-multiblocks/defining-multiblocks.md)** for instructions.
