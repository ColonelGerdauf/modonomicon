# Book Creation with Datagen

If you are working on a modpack the default way to create a book is to manually create and edit the JSON files. This is, however, not recommended, as JSON is not a particularly user friendly format for text editing. It is much easier to use the Modonomicon Datagen API to create your book. 

This requires setting up a basic dev environment to use datagen. The generated JSON files can then be copied into your modpack's datapack as usual. 
If you have not done this before it may seem daunting, but this documentation will provide a step-by-step guide as well as a template project to get you started quickly.

The step-by-step guide and template project are not yet done. We are working on it, bear with us!
