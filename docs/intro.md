Modonomicon is an in-game documentation mod inspired by Thaumcraft's Thaumonomicon and Patchouli, and aims to provide the best of both, with some unique flavors. 

Some of the most interesting features are:
- Fully data-driven, all books are created via datapack (that means both Modpacks and Mods can add books).
- Made to be extensible, mods can add new features, such as recipe pages for mod-specific crafting methods.
- "Quest/Advancement"-style 2D view to navigate the content, as seen in the Thaumonomicon.

- Easy styling of content with (extended) Markdown syntax.
- Various page types to display text, recipes, images, items and more.
